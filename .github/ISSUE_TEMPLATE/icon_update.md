Before opening a new issue search for duplicate or closed issues.

When reporting an update to an icon include helpful information such as:
* The requested iconâ€™s brand name in the title.
* Links to official sources for the brand's icon and colors (e.g. media kits, brand guidelines, SVG files etc.).
* Make sure the title starts with "Update:" and includes whether it concerns the "Icon" or "Color".
