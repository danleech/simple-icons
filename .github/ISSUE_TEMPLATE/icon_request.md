about: Request a new icon for SimpleIcons
---

Before opening a new issue search for duplicate or closed issues.

When requesting a new icon include helpful information such as:
* The requested iconâ€™s brand name in the title.
* Links to official sources for the brand's icon and colors (e.g. media kits, brand guidelines, SVG files etc.).
* Make sure the title starts with "Request:".

In addition to that remember that:
* We won't add generic icons (such as email or arrows) since our goal is to provide brand logos.
* We won't add anything related to illegal services (e.g. piracy, malware, threatening material, spam, etc.).
