Before opening your pull request, have a quick look at our contribution guidelines (https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md)

When adding a new icon, or updating an existing one, remember to:
* Tell us why you chose the color you picked.
* Reference the issue, if any, the pull request addresses.
* Make sure you optimized the icon with SVGO or SVGOMG.
* Make sure the icon has been resized to have a `viewbox` of `0 0 24 24` (and no width and height attribute).
