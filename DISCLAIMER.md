## Copyright & Trademark

The Simple Icons package contains a number of logos with specific requirements around their use. Where this is the case, we aim to provide access to the proper guidelines through the 'guidelines' property in the NPM package, or through links on our website. We ask that our users read these terms fully, and display logos at their own risk. Simple Icons cannot be held responsible for any legal activity raised by a brand. If the icon includes a (registered) trademark icon we follow the guidelines [in our Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md#icon-guidelines) to decide whether to include the symbol or not.

## Guidelines

While we make every effort to provide guidelines on using an icon, brand style guides frequently change and it is up to users of the project to ensure each icon is used correctly and with permission.

## Removal of Brands

Should a brand wish for their icon to be removed from the package, please submit an issue on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons/issues/new/choose) explaining your affiliation with the company, and reasons for removal. We generally remove icons that no longer [meet our criteria](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md#requesting-an-icon) twice a year in our major releases - but can occasionally make exceptions for immediate removal of brands.
