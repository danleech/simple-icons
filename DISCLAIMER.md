## Copyrights & Trademarks

The Simple Icons project contains a number of icons with specific requirements around their usage. Where this is the case, we aim to provide access to the proper guidelines through the `guidelines` entry in our JSON file, in our NPM package and through links on our [website].

Some icons are also in the project under specific `licenses`, and we will endeavour to include the relevant information in the JSON file. The lack of a license entry in the JSON does not imply there is no license, simply that we haven't catalogued it yet.

We ask that users of icons in the collection read the guidelines and license agreements fully and display the icons in accordance with them and, where applicable, with the necessary permissions.

If a logo or icon includes a registered trademark or trademark symbol we follow the recommendations outline [in our Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md#icon-guidelines) to decide whether to include the symbol or not.

~Simple Icons cannot be held responsible for any legal activity raised by a brand over our users' usage of their icon.~

## Guidelines

> NOTE: the addition of guidelines to our project is an ongoing project so the absence of a `guidelines` entry for a particular icon does not imply that guidelines for that icon do not exist.

As guidelines are subject to change and, as we rely largely on our community to help us keep our project updated, the guidelines included in our project for a particular icon may be outdated. Therefore we also ask that users of our project do their own due diligence in researching a brand's guidelines. Additionally, we ask you to inform us of outdated brand guidelines through the [GitHub repository].

## Update of Brands

If the icon in the project does not match the current icon for a brand, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons/issues/new/choose), and a member of the community will update the brand in due course. 

## Removal of Brands

Should a brand wish for their icon to be removed from the package, please submit an issue on the [GitHub repository] explaining your affiliation with the company, and reasons for removal. We generally remove icons that no longer [meet our criteria](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md#requesting-an-icon) twice a year in our major releases - but can occasionally make exceptions for immediate removal of brands.

Urgent requests for removal can be made by contacting `removals at simpleicons dot org`.
