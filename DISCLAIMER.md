# Disclaimer

Simple Icons asks that users read this disclaimer fully before including an icon in their project.

## Copyright & Trademark

The Simple Icons package contains a number of logos with specific requirements around their use. Where this is the case, we aim to provide access to the proper guidelines through the 'guidelines' property in the NPM package, or through links on our website. We ask that our users read these terms fully, and display logos at their own risk. Simple Icons cannot be held responsible for any legal activity raised by a brand. If the icon includes a (registered) trademark icon we follow the guidelines below to decide whether to include the symbol or not:

- If brand guidelines explicitly require including the symbol, it must be included.
- If the symbol is incorporated into the design of the logo (e.g. [Intel](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons/blob/develop/icons/intel.svg)), it must be included.
- If there is ambiguity about the conditions under which the symbol is required, it must be included if it is a registered trademark symbol (®) but not if is a trademark symbol (™).
- If brand guidelines say it may be removed, usually when the icon is displayed at small sizes, it must not be included.
- If there is no explicit requirement that a symbol must be included, it must not be included.

## Removal of Brands

Should a brand wish for their icon to be removed from the package, please submit an issue on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons/issues/new/choose) explaining your affiliation with the company, and reasons for removal. We generally remove icons that no longer [meet our criteria](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md#requesting-an-icon) twice a year in our major releases - but can occasionally make exceptions for immediate removal of brands.
